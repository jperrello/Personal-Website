      <h2 class="text-2xl text-center font-bold mb-4">About Me</h2>
      
      <p class="text-lg">I have always been eager to step out of the comfort zone that the Central Valley has provided me. The question of what more could be waiting for me in the outside world was answered in the summer of 2023 when I applied and was granted the opportunity to work for a small startup in London named Filisia. Nervous and eager to learn, I stepped on the plane to travel to a foreign land to see what awaited me. </p>
      <p class="text-lg">While working at my 2023 internship at Filisia, I learned that the team was developing an app to educate academically challenged children across London. I was tasked with redesigning the team’s backend data system, which lacked the ability to adequately visualize children’s progress in response times and their academic advancement. Before this point, I had completed research in network analysis with Python on large datasets for Google’s ExploreCSR program. My work with educational software at Fisilia piqued my interest in data processing as a means to optimize core functionality of web services, such as data visualization or recommendation systems. However, working with a dedicated team of engineers forty hours a week opened my eyes to a whole new world of software engineering. By the end of my time with the Filisia team, I had created an entire interactive visualization system to help future employees and users track the progression of young children. </p>
      <p class="text-lg">My passion for computer science and my belief in its ability to solve complex problems grew and deepened when, after returning home, I worked with two classmates on a semester-long project creating a web service to facilitate academic research for college students. Our team sought to optimize outdated navigational tools. Accordingly, we developed a system for keeping track of research articles and reducing irrelevant search results, effecting a more streamlined research experience for college students. This, along with my work on advancing technology to help young, academically challenged children in England, has inspired me to push the boundaries of my personal knowledge of software engineering and Computer Science.</p>
      <p class="text-lg">The aforementioned experiences have helped bring my career goals into sharper focus. Now, I am a full time master's student at UCSC, studying censorship and cybersecurity. Simultaneously, I am a TA for an upper division CSE course entitled Database Systems. I am eager to finish my master's degree and contribute academic research to the field of Computer Science.</p>
